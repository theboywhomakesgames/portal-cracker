# Portal Cracker

This is so simple and dumb but maybe useful. There is a tf model and some cv2 preprocessing shit that can extract digits and detect the number and give you an output.


# How to use?!

Well. There is a *model_test.py* file that has everything you need to know in it. There is also the dataset on which the model was trained in *ppds* folder.
Just load the tf model and use the function to pre process and extract digits. You'll be fine.
